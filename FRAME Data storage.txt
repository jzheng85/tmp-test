Frame Data Storage
Main Concepts


Vision
A universal, cloud-native data fabric that provides every FRAME app with independent, multi-modal storage (SQL, NoSQL, Vector, Graph, Object), fully governed encrypted, provisioned and migratable via a single control plane
Tagline: “One API. Any storage. Full encryption. Full governance.”

Problem Statement
FRAME requires a unified, governable, multi-model data substrate enabling FRAME Apps to consume SQL, NoSQL, Vector, Graph, and Object storage without knowing underlying engines
The challenge is to standardize storage provisioning, governance, tenancy, compliance, observability, and developer experience


Objectives
Unified all storage API
App-level isolation
Automated provisioning and migration
Multi-cloud + Multi-region compatibility
Full governance (OPA, RBAC, audit) and lineage
Encryption everywhere by design
Self-service developer-friendly experience


High Level Architecture
FRAME Apps -> UDL SDK -> UDL Broker -> Storage Engines
Apps get access via FRAME SDK
The broker is a software layer that abstracts all storage engines info one unified layer, this is UDL as in Unified Data Layer. It is a multi-model broker that fronts specialized engines
The storage engines are any kind of storage we need to have
We need a storage control plane layer to help with all provisioning and migrations
UDL: is a multi-modal broker that fronts specialized engines
SQL: PotgreSQL (with pg_partman, timescale optional), pgVector extension available
NoSQL: MongoDB
Vector DB: Weaviate(or pgVector on postgres when locality matters)
Graph: Neo4j / Memgraph
Object: MinIO (S3-compatible)
SCP: Operator & APIs that:
Provision per-App storage (isolatioin)
Issue credentials/secrets, network policies and quotas
Expose endpoints / DSNs to Apps
Orchestrate migration (same-type or cross-type where sensible)
Enforce policy, encryption, backup/DR, and lifecycle
The storage engines are any kind of storage we need to have


Conceptual Overview
Unified Data Layer (UDL): logical abstraction that exposes uniform APIs to Apps for data access, regardless of underlying engine type
Storage Control Plane (SCP): Kubernetes-base governance & automation layer that provisions, secures, migrates, and monitors per-App storages
Engines behind the scenes: PostgreSQL(SQL+pgVector), MongoDB(NoSQL), Weaviate(Vector),Neo4j/Memgraph(Graph),MinIO(Object)
Every App runs in tis owner namespace, with independent DB instances or schemas, buckets, and credentials. No cross-contamination


FRAME UDL Properties
A consistent, governed, multi-modal data layer that Apps can rely on for reliable, low-latency, queryable and programmatically accessible storage with properties:
Isolation
Governance
Queryability
Consistent CRUD
Observability
Versioning

Provisioning Flow
Storage Claim: Defines a request for a specific data storage(SQL, vector, object, etc..)
Data Pipeline: Defines ingestion / transformation pipeline with their sources and target
